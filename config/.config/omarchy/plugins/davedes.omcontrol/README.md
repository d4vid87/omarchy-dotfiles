# OmaControl

An Omarchy shell plugin (Quickshell, Hyprland) that turns your top-bar icon into an advanced task manager — live system monitoring, per-app history, process control, and privacy alerts.

## Features

- **Live bar stats** — CPU, temps, RAM, network, and more as a compact, customizable icon
- **App Window** with tabs for Activity (live graphs, 1H/6H/1D), Apps (running processes + trust status), Alerts, Events, and Settings
- **Per-app details** — CPU/mem/GPU/I/O history, provenance, and live socket counts (no root needed)
- **Privacy alerts** — notified when camera, mic, or location get used
- **Process control** — kill, suspend/resume, renice, or permanently disable an app
- **Historical database** — SQLite-backed samples every 2s, downsampled over time
- **Sustained alert hysteresis** — resource alarms must hold across samples and stay latched for a grace window, so the bell doesn't flicker near a threshold
- **Privacy-tier alerts** — process-level spikes are toggleable via the "App Activity" sensitivity, so the window can stop naming specific processes
- **Per-process network attribution** — optional toggle; turning it off hides the per-process net column entirely (instead of showing zeroes)
- **Adaptive sampling + stale indicator** — the bar back-off when idle and warns when fresh data stops arriving
- **Configurable alert sensitivity** — alert thresholds resolve from a single model (mild / medium / severe profiles, with per-metric overrides) shared by the bar, app window, and CLI; switch from the Settings tab or `omcontrol alert-prefs set-profile <mild|medium|severe>`
- **Self-healing config + storage** — a corrupt `alert_prefs.json` / `barstats.json` is quarantined to `<file>.corrupt` (with a warning) instead of silently passing bad state, and alert-prefs writes are atomic; collector health is tracked so `omcontrol status` reports healthy/stale/failed sampling

## Installation

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Davedes83/OmaControl.git --enable
```

Add the widget to `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:

```json
{
  "bar": {
    "layout": {
      "right": [{ "id": "davedes.omcontrol" }]
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
omarchy restart shell
```

### Optional: background history sampler

The bar widget and CLI record while the shell is running. To also fill history
when the shell is closed, enable the hardened user service (fixed `PATH`,
`LC_ALL=C`, strict umask, process-group timeouts on every helper):

```bash
systemctl --user enable --now ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/davedes.omcontrol/systemd/omcontrol-collect.service
```

Verify: `systemctl --user status omcontrol-collect` and `omcontrol status`.

## Usage

- **Left-click** — open/close the App Window
- **Middle-click** — refresh sample
- **Right-click** — context menu (jump to tab, enforce rules, kill top process)

Also ships a CLI — `omcontrol status [--json]`, `omcontrol top [--history 30m] [--sort peak|cpu|mem|combined] [--json|--csv]`, `omcontrol history [--metric cpu] [--seconds 300] [--json|--csv]`, `omcontrol app kill <name>`, `omcontrol prune [--metrics|--procs|--events]`, `omcontrol vacuum`, and `omcontrol alert-prefs ...` — run `omcontrol --help` for the full list.

## Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove davedes.omcontrol
systemctl --user disable --now omcontrol-collect
```

## Requirements

- [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) Linux, Hyprland, Quickshell
- `sqlite3`, `python3`, `nvidia-smi` (optional, for GPU metrics)

## Development / Testing

The test suite exercises the schema migration/repair paths, the collector
end-to-end, `prefs.py` validation + lock/atomic-rename concurrency, corruption
quarantine for both preference stores, alert-threshold profile/override
resolution, and the enforcement dry-run contract (mocked systemctl) — all
against throwaway state, so the user's real `history.db` is never touched.
Run it under any shell you like:

```bash
tests/run-tests.sh              # default: sh
tests/run-tests.sh dash         # strict POSIX (Debian/Ubuntu default sh)
tests/run-tests.sh bash --posix # bash in POSIX compatibility mode
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the suite under `dash`, `bash`, and
`bash --posix`, plus static gates: shellcheck, `shfmt --diff`, Python
`compileall`, JSON validation, and a structural QML/JS bracket-balance check.
`qmllint` runs as an informational step only — it needs the Quickshell module
tree the CI image doesn't ship.
